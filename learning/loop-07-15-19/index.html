<h1>Learning Loop 07/15/19</h1>

<h3>Intro and Context</h3>

<p>I want to learn about sharing geographical information on the web.</p>

<p>I’ve already learned about how to create custom geographical information by watching a QGIS3 tutorial <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCnNWyl9qSE" title="on youtube">on youtube</a>. </p>

<p>I’ve already learned about how to create websites by working as a professional computer programmer and studying computers in university.</p>

<h3>What I will do</h3>

<p>Now I need to learn about how to publish my maps on a website.</p>

<p>First I’m going to research all the different options that are available and experiment with the most promising choices. I will document this process as a list.</p>

<p>Then I’m going to make a simple map of the ancient world by copying some information from a book that I’m reading called <em>The Manifesto for a Democractic Civilization vol. 1</em> and publish it on my personal website. </p>
